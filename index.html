        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Hippopotamus, also know as hippos, are herbivores. Their main food source is grass. Compare to their weight, hipposâ€™ food intake is low. Nile crocodiles, lions, and spotted hyenas prey on hippos. Humans hunt hippos for their teeth and meat. Crocodiles prey on hippos, but they are considered competitors too. Along with crocodiles, elephants are competitors. Hippos live in Africa. They live in biomes like rivers, lakes, or mangrove swamps.

        <h3>Adapation</h3>
        
        <h4>Structural #1</h4>
        <p>
            Hippos have eyes, ears, and nostrils that are placed high on their skull. These organs are placed high on their skull because it help them survive. Hippos spend many hours underwater to stay cool and having these organs placed like this allow the hippos to see, hear, and breath underwater.

        <h4>Structural #2</h4>
        <p>
            Hippos have a barrel-shaped body. They have a graviportal skeletal structure. This body shape help hippos survive better. Hippos need to get under water to cool themselves off, so this body shape sinks the hippos to the bottom. Their body shape are adapted to support their body weight too. Without this shape, hippos will move slowly from predators.

        <h4>Structural #3</h4>
        <p>
            Hippos can open their mouth up to 150 degrees. They have a bit force of 1,800 pounds! Their teeth sharpen when they grind with each other. Although their mouth are strong, they are use for combat not feeding. Without their strong mouth, predators can easily prey on them. With this weapon, hippos can protect themselves and increase their chance of survival.
